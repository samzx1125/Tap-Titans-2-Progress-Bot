About Adv-Click script:
- full script package lol

About Push script:
- THIS SCRIPT HAS NO PRESTIGE, NO SKILL LEVEL UP (just activate), ONLY RECENT HERO LEVEL UP
- do not request for prestige function with this script. Use Adv-Click for prestige

## Basic Requirements:
 - Android 5 Device or Emulator (ONLY MEMU, Bluestacks untested)
   - confirmed working stable version: 5.5.5 (July 12)
 - Resolution 480x800 (you can change it maybe if your device is different)
 - DPI 128 (stable but not the best)
 - Root, for HiroMacro

- - - - -

# Installation
## Memu system options
 - Download Memu (Bluestacks untested. Crashes too often on Nox so do NOT use Nox)
   - confirmed working stable version: 5.5.5 (July 12)
 - Enable root
 - Set screen size to: 480x800
 
## Android 5 options
 - Android Settings -> SuperUser -> disable notifications
 
## Apps needed
 - Install HiroMacro
 - Install Tap Titans 2
 - Install custom launcher (use any from the play store; I use Nova)
   - important to change default launcher to prevent emulator memory issues and background ad app downloads
   
## Copying and transfering codes into Memu
because copy-paste does not retain format, do the following:

1. On your computer
 - Copy codes and save as .txt files (for convenience, save on Desktop)

2. On Memu
 - Look for "Shared Folder" button on toolbar (default is along the right side) and click it
 - A new window will open, click "Open" for any shared folder (I use "Shared Download Path", but it _really_ doesn't matter)
 - 2 things should happen:
  - Windows File Explorer should open the chosen shared folder
  - Memu will change windows to Memu File Manager and also on the shared folder

3. Back to computer
 - Put a copy of .txt file into the newly opened shared folder (default Memu-PC shared download folder path is <user>/Downloads/MEmu Download )
 
4. On Memu again
 - Using Memu file manager (which you should now be on), first click the "..." parent folder to go out of the folder then re-open the same folder as in step 2 to refresh the contents of the folder
 - locate .txt file/s from the chosen shared folder
 - tick the box of the .txt files you placed so that they are selected (put check marks on the boxes to the left of the files)
 - click "..." parent folder again and look for HiroMacro Documents folder (path is 0/HiroMacro/Documents )
 - click the button on the lower left (looks like 6 dots)
 - choose "Copy selection here" and .txt files should be copied into Hiro Documents folder
 - you can now activate Hiro (volume down by default) and the codes should appear by .txt filename
 
## HiroMacro Settings
 - HiroMacro Settings -> Color Access Method -> ScreenCapture
 - Start HiroMacro Service
 - Start Tap Titans 2
 - Click on volume down to start the script
 - again to stop
 
## Optional settings for better performance:
 - Set ScreenCapture delay in HiroMakro settings to 0
 - Increase ram to 1500 or more.
 - Increase used cores to 2 or more.
